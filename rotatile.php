/**
 * Plugin Name:       Rotatile
 * Plugin URI:        https://github.com/Fyrins/rotatile
 * Description:       Adds a Rotation panel to the WordPress block inspector so a supported block can be tilted by a free angle. The angle is turned into a CSS transform when the page is built, so the front end ships no JavaScript.
 * Version:           1.0.0
 * Requires at least: 6.6
 * Requires PHP:      7.4
 * Author:            Alexandre Revire
 * Author URI:        https://alexandre-revire.fr
 * License:           GPL-2.0-or-later
 * License URI:       https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 * Text Domain:       rotatile
