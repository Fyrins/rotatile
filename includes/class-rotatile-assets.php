 *
 * It is registered lazily, at that same moment, rather than on a hook of its
 * own, because the order of `render_block` and `wp_enqueue_scripts` is not
 * fixed. With a block theme the template is rendered before `wp_head`, so
 * `render_block` runs first and a style registered on `wp_enqueue_scripts` does
 * not exist yet; with a classic theme the content is rendered from inside the
 * template, long after. Registering on demand makes the plugin indifferent to
 * which of the two it is dealing with: early enough and the stylesheet goes out
 * in the head, late enough and WordPress prints it in the footer.
 *
 * Either way nothing depends on the timing, because the rotation itself is an
 * inline declaration written into the markup.
